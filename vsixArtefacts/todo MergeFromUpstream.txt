SYNC WITH UPSTREAM
==================
git remote -v // List the current configured remote repository for your fork.
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ardalis/cleanarchitecture.git // Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork.
git remote -v // Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork.
git fetch upstream // Commits to master will be stored in a local branch, upstream/master.
git checkout master // Check out your fork's local master branch.
git merge upstream/master // Merge the changes from upstream/master into your local master branch. This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.
